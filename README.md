# Spring2023AdvancedAlgorithms Experimental Branch
**NOTE: This branch contains features such as Git Actions and Ansible Galaxy modules that may or may not be used for Spring 2023. These features are kept in this branch so they do not conflict with the main branch.**

## Installing Required Libraries
To install the required libraries for the course, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the main folder of the repository. This assumes you already have Python and pip installed on your system.

## Installing Recommended Githooks
While they're not required for the course, git hooks are recommended for keeping your code style up-to-date. You can install the git hooks by running `pre-commit install` in the main folder of the repository.
