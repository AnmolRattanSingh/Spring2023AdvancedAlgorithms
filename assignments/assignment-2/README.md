# Assignment 2 (Travelling Salesman Problem Approximation)

To get started with this assignment, work on the `tsp_approx_starter.py` file in the `tsp` folder and fill in the `tsp()` function, as well as the `getTSPApprox()` and `getTSPOptimal()` methods in `Map` class with your implementation.

Unit tests can be found in `tsp/tsp_approx_tests.py`; to use them, simply `cd` into the `tsp` folder and run `pytest .` or `pytest -vv .` for more information on failures and hints as to what might be wrong (the -v flag indicates how __verbose__ you want your output to be - adding more v's increases the verbosity of your output).
